    "# SEC Filing Linguistic Features for Numerai\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "SEC filings (10-K annual reports, 10-Q quarterly, 8-K events) are the most structured, reliable public text data for US equities. Every public company must file, and filings are freely available on EDGAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why SEC Filings for Numerai\n",
    "- **Point-in-time correct**: Filing dates are exact — no look-ahead bias\n",
    "- **Universal coverage**: Every US public company files (covers Numerai's entire US stock universe)\n",
    "- **Linguistic changes are subtle signals**: When a company's 10-K suddenly becomes harder to read or more litigious, it often precedes negative returns\n",
    "- **Orthogonal to standard factors**: Readability, sentiment shifts, and topic changes are NOT captured by Barra factors (momentum, value, size)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features We'll Extract\n",
    "1. **Readability**: Gunning Fog Index, word/sentence complexity\n",
    "2. **Loughran-McDonald Sentiment**: Finance-specific word lists (positive, negative, uncertainty, litigious)\n",
    "3. **Filing-over-filing deltas**: Changes in features between consecutive filings\n",
    "4. **Forward-looking language**: Ratio of forward-looking statements"

    "Products\n",
    "iPhone. iPhone is the Company's line of smartphones based on its iOS operating system. The current lineup includes \n",
    "iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 15, and iPhone 15 Plus. iPhone revenue decreased year-over-year during 2023 \n",
    "primarily driven by different launch timing of different iPhone models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mac. Mac is the Company's line of personal computers based on its macOS operating system. The current lineup includes \n",
    "MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio and Mac Pro. Mac revenue decreased year-over-year during 2023 \n",

    "\n",
    "Services. Services includes advertising, AppleCare, cloud services, digital content, and payment services. \n",
    "Services revenue increased year-over-year during 2023 driven primarily by higher revenue from advertising, \n",

    "personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. \n",
    "The Company's financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide \n",
    "downward pressures on gross margins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk Factors\n",
    "The Company's operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact \n",
    "on levels of consumer spending. Markets for the Company's products and services are competitive and the Company \n",
    "faces aggressive competition in all areas of its business. The Company faces risks related to supply chain \n",
    "disruptions, including from pandemics, geopolitical tensions, and natural disasters. The Company may be subject to \n",
    "information technology system failures, network disruptions, and cybersecurity threats. Changes in tax rates, \n",

    "\n",
    "We have experienced significant price reductions across our vehicle lineup in response to competitive pressures \n",
    "and to maintain demand. These price reductions have negatively impacted our automotive gross margins, which \n",

    "Energy Generation and Storage\n",
    "We manufacture and sell solar energy systems and energy storage products for residential, commercial and \n",

    "\n",
    "Risk Factors\n",
    "We may be unable to grow our business as planned. Our vehicles may experience quality issues or defects that \n",
    "could result in voluntary or involuntary recalls. We face risks related to our CEO's other business activities \n",
    "and public statements. We have significant debt and may need additional capital. Our future growth depends on \n",
    "demand for electric vehicles, which may not materialize at the rate we expect. Regulatory changes could \n",

    "## Discussion & Interview Talking Points\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths\n",
    "- **Point-in-time correct by design**: SEC filings have exact filing dates — no ambiguity\n",
    "- **Universal US coverage**: Every public company must file\n",
    "- **Well-studied academically**: Loughran-McDonald (2011) is the gold standard; many published papers validate these features\n",
    "- **Low churn**: Filings change quarterly/annually — naturally stable features (Numerai penalizes high churn)\n",
    "- **Deltas are the real signal**: Filing-over-filing changes capture management's evolving risk perception\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses\n",
    "- **Low frequency**: Only 4 filings per year (10-K + 3x 10-Q). 8-K events are more frequent but shorter.\n",
    "- **Delayed**: Companies have 60 days after quarter-end to file — features lag reality\n",
    "- **Boilerplate**: Much 10-K language is copy-pasted year-to-year. Must focus on CHANGED sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orthogonality Assessment\n",
    "- **Readability metrics**: Probably somewhat orthogonal — Numerai is unlikely to have Fog Index\n",
    "- **LM sentiment on filings**: Somewhat known, but filing-level is less common than news-level\n",
    "- **Filing deltas**: Likely orthogonal — tracking linguistic CHANGES is non-standard\n",
    "- **Best combined with**: FinBERT on the same filings (NB01), topic modeling (NB04), or embeddings (NB02)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key References\n",
    "- Loughran & McDonald (2011): \"When is a Liability not a Liability?\" — showed general dictionaries are wrong for finance\n",
    "- Li (2008): \"Annual Report Readability, Current Earnings, and Earnings Persistence\" — firms with less readable reports have lower future earnings\n",
    "- Cohen et al. (2020): \"Lazy Prices\" — changes in 10-K/Q language predict returns and earnings surprises\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions (TODO)\n",
    "- [ ] Download real filings from EDGAR using sec-edgar-downloader\n",
    "- [ ] Implement full Loughran-McDonald dictionary (download from https://sraf.nd.edu/)\n",
    "- [ ] Compare Item 1A (Risk Factors) across filings — most informative section\n",
    "- [ ] Add Flesch-Kincaid readability score\n",
    "- [ ] Track forward-looking statement ratio changes as a leading indicator\n",
    "- [ ] Build pipeline for all S&P 500 companies"
