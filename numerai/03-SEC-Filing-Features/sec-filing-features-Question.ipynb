    "# SEC Filing Linguistic Features for Numerai\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "SEC filings (10-K annual reports, 10-Q quarterly, 8-K events) are the most structured, reliable public text data for US equities. Every public company must file, and filings are freely available on EDGAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why SEC Filings for Numerai\n",
    "- **Point-in-time correct**: Filing dates are exact \u2014 no look-ahead bias\n",
    "- **Universal coverage**: Every US public company files (covers Numerai's entire US stock universe)\n",
    "- **Linguistic changes are subtle signals**: When a company's 10-K suddenly becomes harder to read or more litigious, it often precedes negative returns\n",
    "- **Orthogonal to standard factors**: Readability, sentiment shifts, and topic changes are NOT captured by Barra factors (momentum, value, size)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features We'll Extract\n",
    "1. **Readability**: Gunning Fog Index, word/sentence complexity\n",
    "2. **Loughran-McDonald Sentiment**: Finance-specific word lists (positive, negative, uncertainty, litigious)\n",
    "3. **Filing-over-filing deltas**: Changes in features between consecutive filings\n",
    "4. **Forward-looking language**: Ratio of forward-looking statements"

    "## Discussion & Interview Talking Points\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths\n",
    "- **Point-in-time correct by design**: SEC filings have exact filing dates \u2014 no ambiguity\n",
    "- **Universal US coverage**: Every public company must file\n",
    "- **Well-studied academically**: Loughran-McDonald (2011) is the gold standard; many published papers validate these features\n",
    "- **Low churn**: Filings change quarterly/annually \u2014 naturally stable features (Numerai penalizes high churn)\n",
    "- **Deltas are the real signal**: Filing-over-filing changes capture management's evolving risk perception\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses\n",
    "- **Low frequency**: Only 4 filings per year (10-K + 3x 10-Q). 8-K events are more frequent but shorter.\n",
    "- **Delayed**: Companies have 60 days after quarter-end to file \u2014 features lag reality\n",
    "- **Boilerplate**: Much 10-K language is copy-pasted year-to-year. Must focus on CHANGED sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orthogonality Assessment\n",
    "- **Readability metrics**: Probably somewhat orthogonal \u2014 Numerai is unlikely to have Fog Index\n",
    "- **LM sentiment on filings**: Somewhat known, but filing-level is less common than news-level\n",
    "- **Filing deltas**: Likely orthogonal \u2014 tracking linguistic CHANGES is non-standard\n",
    "- **Best combined with**: FinBERT on the same filings (NB01), topic modeling (NB04), or embeddings (NB02)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key References\n",
    "- Loughran & McDonald (2011): \"When is a Liability not a Liability?\" \u2014 showed general dictionaries are wrong for finance\n",
    "- Li (2008): \"Annual Report Readability, Current Earnings, and Earnings Persistence\" \u2014 firms with less readable reports have lower future earnings\n",
    "- Cohen et al. (2020): \"Lazy Prices\" \u2014 changes in 10-K/Q language predict returns and earnings surprises\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions (TODO)\n",
    "- [ ] Download real filings from EDGAR using sec-edgar-downloader\n",
    "- [ ] Implement full Loughran-McDonald dictionary (download from https://sraf.nd.edu/)\n",
    "- [ ] Compare Item 1A (Risk Factors) across filings \u2014 most informative section\n",
    "- [ ] Add Flesch-Kincaid readability score\n",
    "- [ ] Track forward-looking statement ratio changes as a leading indicator\n",
    "- [ ] Build pipeline for all S&P 500 companies"
