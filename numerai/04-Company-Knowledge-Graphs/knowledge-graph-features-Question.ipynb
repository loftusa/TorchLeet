    "## Context\n",
    "This is where my background maps most directly to Numerai's needs. My Cambridge University Press textbook (524 pages, 147 figures) covers spectral methods, community detection, and statistical inference on networks \u2014 all applicable to extracting graph-based features from financial text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Knowledge Graphs for Numerai\n",
    "- **Highly orthogonal**: Graph topology features (centrality, clustering, community structure) are fundamentally different from Barra factors (momentum, value, size). Numerai's neutralization won't remove them.\n",
    "- **Supply chain propagation**: Shocks propagate through company networks. A supplier's bad news affects its customers \u2014 graph features capture this.\n",
    "- **Co-mention networks**: Companies mentioned together in news share latent relationships that predict correlated returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline\n",
    "Financial text \u2192 NER (extract company names) \u2192 Co-mention graph \u2192 Graph features per node \u2192 Stock-level predictions\n",
